# name_generator_by_LSTM


This project is a simple example of the generator function of artificial intelligence. <br>
Within the scope of the project, the model was trained using a dataset of 6782 English first names, and it was aimed that this model could generate an English name by decoding the word structure patterns of English names. 
Since the order and position of the letters in the names are important, the bi-directional LSTM model was used.
